## Road to adoption

+ Pricing starting point maps cyber-gubi 1 to 1 with your local currency - this is purely for reference since it can not be exchanged
+ When we have enough influence and purchasing power expressed in number of people on basic income and amount of tokens received we can ask retailers to accept it
+ Once a big enough commercial network wants to use it due to the amount of potential customers having it there is a push towards states to accept it as a form of currency to pay taxes in
+ A free-market economy sets in and starts regulating internal pricing independently of other currencies
+ The value of cyber-gubi is defined by each retailer setting a price on own products
+ Wages in cyber-gubis are adjusted based on arbitrage between product prices and profit
+ All-in-one depots emerge where you pay a monthly fee and use and return instead of own

## FAQ

+ Why not list it on exchanges and pay taxes in the accepted local currency?
    + It will immediately be speculated with and inflated/deflated.
+ Can I create multiple wallets?
    + No, your account is linked to your face which will get recognized on any new device.
+ How to adjust supply/burn rate based on increase of prices?
    + Keep track of all price changes for all goods on a monthly basis and re-index the basic income amount according to inflation
+ Why is there no mobile version?
    + App stores are centralized and can take down the app anytime. You can use a mini laptop with Linux instead.
+ How does closing an account influence the economy?
    + Closing an account means all money of the person are destroyed. This will cause deflation as the money supply gets lower.
